  "declaration.important": "One of the key features of blockchain is openness. Anyone can retrieve the data of all blocks from the chain. Although blockchain projects, including Bitcoin, use anonymous transactions, it is still possible to identify both transacting parties by analyzing the data address and relevant IPs. In some transactions, people do not need or want to let others know the details, especially the object of transaction.",
